# Central

Central - an interesting resque & sinatra-boilerplate based cluster management system!

Most of the orchestration platforms out there are java based, or just a bit ugly to set up.  This project strives to do it The Ruby Way, and offer more flexibility in the types of actions that can occur.

# Sinatra Boilerplate
